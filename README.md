# Field Condition

## Description
The module exposes an entity field condition which can be configured to hide or show a block  based on the host entity field value. Not only does this condition work with blocks, it can be used with any contributed module that utilizes the condition plugin system. Currently this only works for node entities, but there are plans to expand this concept to other entity types.


## How to Use

- Enable the `field_condition` module.
- Navigate to the block layout page `/admin/structure/block`.
- Click **Place block** or **Configure** an existing block.
- Under the **Visibility** settings you'll see the **Entity field** section, click to show configuration options.
- Configure the necessary field condition, then click **Save**.
